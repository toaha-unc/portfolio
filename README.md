- **3D Interactive Background**: A dynamic particle system built with Three.js that responds to mouse movement
- **Smooth Scroll Animations**: Professional-grade animations using GSAP with scroll triggers
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom cursor, click effects, and animated skill badges
- **Dynamic Content**: GitHub profile integration and functional contact form
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across all devices with mobile-first approach
